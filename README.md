# Project: Password Generator

Link to project: https://pinkrobocop.github.io/M5C/

## Overview
 
I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. 
This app runs in the browser, and it features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive. This ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password includes special characters. 
See this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## Instructions

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
